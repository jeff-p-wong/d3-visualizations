## Summary
In this graphic, you can find out the likelihood of surviving the Titanic Tragedy based on specific parameters (Gender, Age and Class). Simply, select the demographic information on the right sidebar to see the likelihood on a pie graph and the survival data on the bar graph.Notice that if you were female, you had a 75% chance of surviving while if you were male, you had a 21% chance. However, please notice that there were 259 women and 453 men. As for age, children under 16 had a 59% chance of surviving while the eldest had a 36% chance. However, on the bar graph, you will notice that only 49 children under the age of 16 survived and 54 adults over 45 survived. Obviously, if you were First class ticket holders, you had the highest chance and number of people surviving. However, notice that there were signifiantly higher number of Third-class passengers. 

## Design
I wanted to design a graphic that would allow the user to visualise their chances of surviving the titanic tragedy. To do this, I needed to build a sidebar panel that allowed users to select their demographic information (gender, age and hypothetical class). I decided that the pie graph would allow users to see their chances of surviving the easiest. Though it may have interpretation problems, as noted by the feedback, I wanted the data to be impactful. Thus despite feedback, I decided to keep it. I wanted to show the real data using the bar graph to tell a different side of the story using the exact same data. Specifically, even if there was a higher chance of survival, the absolute numbers might tell a different story. 

Initially, I did not think to show a story and wanted my users to explore. But given the feedback, I decided to focus on each feature of the data. The animation first focuses on the data divided by gender, moving on to age and then class. After that, the user is encouraged to look for differences between a young first class girl and an old third class man.

In my initial designs, I wanted to add as many animations as I could possibly add. That meant updating the y-axis as much as possible. However it became clear that most people thought it was distracting and one user wanted me to remove it. I decided to keep it there because a bar graph didn't feel like a bar graph without the y-axis. I opted to remove most of the animations instead. A very helpful point that the feedback brought up was adding a text to the bar graph. I decided to animate this using something I came across on the internet. Credits are written in the code. 

#### What I ended up doing
A hover text animation was added to help users see the data rather than compare it with the y-axis. A story was also introduced. I was about to delete the pie graph until this comment. I'm grateful that others appreciate my original idea.
